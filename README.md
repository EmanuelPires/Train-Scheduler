# Train-Scheduler

This is an app which uses moment.js and firebase to provide train schedules based on the user's input of first train time and train rate.
Wrapping my head around understanding that moment() provides an object with information about that particular moment that the function is fired. Once I was able to format what the moment was returning then I was able to make progress with the site responding to the user's inputs.
